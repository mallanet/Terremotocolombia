# Terremoto Colombia — terremotocolombia.co

*[Léelo en español](README.es.md)*

Live disaster-response site for the **2026 Colombia earthquake**, run by
[Mallanet.org](https://mallanet.org): a real-time citizen emergency map with
georeferenced incident reports, a missing-persons + hospital/shelter directory,
a collection-center directory, and an admin panel with role-based access.

**→ https://terremotocolombia.co**

> This is **not** the generic template any more — it is a live deployment
> serving real traffic. It began as a fork of a disaster-response template, and
> most of the code is still generic: every identity value (organization,
> disaster name, region, domains, contact, map center) still lives in
> `config/deployment.config.json`, never hardcoded. But the standup already
> happened, the identity is filled in, and **pushing to `main` deploys the
> frontend automatically**.
>
> If you are here to stand up your own deployment for a different disaster,
> start from the upstream template rather than forking this repo — this one
> carries Mallanet's identity and branding.

Agents and contributors: read [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) first — it covers where
this actually runs, what deploys automatically, and what must never be done
without a human.

## This deployment

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Live | **https://terremotocolombia.co** |
| Frontend | Cloudflare Workers (`@opennextjs/cloudflare`) |
| API | Cloudflare Workers, `api.terremotocolombia.co` |
| Database | Neon Postgres (external) |
| Secrets | Doppler — not `.env` files |
| Frontend deploys | **Automatically, on every push to `main`** touching `frontend/**` |
| Backend deploys | Manual only, with an explicit confirmation |

There is no staging environment: **`main` is production.** Not currently
deployed: the admin panel and the BullMQ queue worker. Turnstile is disabled —
see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Who this is for

- Volunteer tech teams and NGOs responding to a specific disaster who need a
  working map + directory site immediately, run by people who are not
  full-time software engineers.
- Orgs that already run disaster-response infrastructure and want a
  documented, scrub-clean base instead of copying a previous event's repo
  (with that event's data, secrets, and assumptions still in it).
- Anyone standing this up with an AI coding agent doing the configuration and
  deploy work, not just the coding.

## The headline: an agent can take this from clone to live deployment

This template ships five [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills
under `.claude/skills/`. Open the repo in an agent that reads `CLAUDE.md`
(Claude Code does this automatically) and ask it to stand up your
deployment — it runs these five skills, in this order:

1. **`disaster-configure`** — writes your organization, disaster, region, map
   center, and domains into `config/deployment.config.json` and the few
   static files that can't read it at runtime (PWA manifest, emergency
   contacts, example event data). Everything else in the app reads from this
   one file.
2. **`disaster-brand`** — applies your colors and logo across
   `docs/DESIGN.md`'s design tokens, the app's CSS variables, the PWA
   manifest, the favicon, and the generated social-preview (OpenGraph/
   Twitter) images.
3. **`disaster-secrets-bootstrap`** — generates every required secret
   (`JWT_SECRET`, `IP_SALT`, database/cache passwords, etc.) with `openssl
   rand` and writes your real `.env`, refusing to finish while any
   `CHANGE_ME` placeholder survives.
4. **`disaster-deploy-vps`** — hardens a fresh Ubuntu VPS (deploy user, UFW,
   fail2ban), installs Docker, brings up `docker-compose.prod.yml` behind
   Caddy with Let's Encrypt TLS on your domains, and runs smoke checks
   (services healthy, TLS issued, a test report goes end-to-end, admin login
   works).
5. **`disaster-content-audit`** — the final gate before you share your fork
   publicly or add contributors: scans the whole tree for the kind of
   literal this template itself was scrubbed of (real IPs, personal emails,
   leftover secrets, a previous event's identity) and refuses to say "clean"
   until it actually is.

Each skill is a `SKILL.md` with exact file paths, verification steps, and
hard stops — an agent doesn't need any tribal knowledge beyond what's in the
repo. The human-readable version of this same path is
[`docs/standup-guide.md`](docs/standup-guide.md); the VPS step alone is
detailed in [`docs/deploy-vps.md`](docs/deploy-vps.md).

## Architecture, in one paragraph

Three Next.js/Express apps behind one reverse proxy. `frontend/` (Next.js +
React + Leaflet) is the public map and directories; it never touches the
database directly, only the API. `backend/` (Express + TypeScript + Drizzle
ORM over Postgres) serves everything under `/api`, plus `backend/worker/`
(BullMQ over Valkey) for background sync, geocoding, deduplication, and
optional hub federation. `admin/` is a separate Next.js microservice — a
backend-for-frontend with its own RBAC (JWT in an httpOnly cookie) that talks
to the backend over the internal network, never straight to the database.
Production is **one VPS**: `docker-compose.prod.yml` + Caddy as the single
TLS-terminating reverse proxy, Postgres and Valkey co-located by default. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full picture.

## Quickstart

With your information ready (org name, disaster/region, domains, real local
emergency numbers — see `docs/standup-guide.md` for the full list), the path
below takes about **30 minutes** of active work, plus however long DNS
propagation takes.

1. Click **Use this template** on GitHub and create your own repository from
   it.
2. Clone your new repository.
3. Open it in Claude Code (or another coding agent that reads
   `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`).
4. Follow `CLAUDE.md` — it points the agent at the standup skills in the
   order above. Answer the questions it asks (your organization's name, your
   region's real emergency numbers, your domains) as they come up; the
   skills refuse to invent this information for you.

Prefer to do it by hand, or want to see every step before an agent runs it?
Read [`docs/standup-guide.md`](docs/standup-guide.md).

## What this template deliberately does NOT include

- **Real datasets.** Every seed (hospitals, missing persons, emergency
  contacts, the reference earthquake event) is synthetic and obviously
  labeled as an example. There is no shortcut that ships real crisis data —
  you provide your region's real information yourself, deliberately, through
  `disaster-configure`.
- **Kubernetes / multi-node / observability stacks.** The supported path is
  one VPS with docker compose and Caddy. A k3s+OpenTofu path and a
  Prometheus/Loki/Grafana observability stack are reasonable next steps at
  larger scale, but they are future work, not part of this template.
- **An i18n framework.** The UI ships in Spanish (the default language for
  this kind of deployment) as plain JSX strings — there is no next-intl/
  i18next abstraction underneath. Localizing to another language today means
  having your agent edit the copy directly; that's a real cost we chose not
  to hide behind a false claim of "multi-language support."

## Safety model

This kind of site collects information about people in crisis. The template
enforces a few things structurally, and asks the deployer to own the rest:

- **Content-audit gate.** `disaster-content-audit` (and `scripts/content-audit/`
  standalone) blocks on any of the literal patterns this repo's own history
  was scrubbed of — the same check that runs before this template's own
  releases runs on every fork that uses it.
- **No-real-data policy.** Seeds and fixtures are synthetic by convention
  (`AGENTS.md` makes this a hard rule for anyone contributing code). Real
  crisis data belongs in your database, never in a commit, an issue, or a
  screenshot.
- **Deployers' PII obligations.** Standing this up means you will collect
  real personal data about people in an emergency. That's a legal and
  ethical responsibility this template cannot discharge for you — see
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for what it does enforce (rate limiting,
  bot-check on public writes, RBAC on the admin surface) and what remains
  yours to decide (retention, access, and eventually decommissioning the
  deployment).

Maintained by [mallanet.org](https://mallanet.org). This template is
extracted from the production platform mallanet built and ran during the
2026 Venezuela earthquake response — the parts specific to that event and
everything sensitive were removed; the parts that make the software work
were kept and made generic. If you use this template for a real deployment,
you're standing on that field experience.
